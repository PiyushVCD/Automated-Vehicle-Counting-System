# Automated-Vehicle-Counting-System
This project implements an automated vehicle detection and counting system using computer vision techniques with Python and OpenCV. The system processes a road traffic video to detect moving vehicles, track them using bounding boxes, and count each vehicle when it crosses a predefined virtual line.
